        <h1>My name is Oumnia.</h1>
        <p>I'm a student at Stanford University originally from Meknes, Morocco. 
            I really care about increasing access to education worldwide, and especially in my home country. 
            I want to understand how we learn and relate to one another, and how we can use technology to promote 
            wider access to knowledge.</p>

        <p>I watch a lot of theater in my free time, and I hope to one day be able to write and direct plays myself.
            I also love learning about different cultures and histories from around the world through reading or podcasts. 
            My other personal interests include drawing, cooking, and learning other languages. I speak Arabic, French and English, 
            can understand and speak some Italian and Spanish, and remember some Japanese from the classes that I took during the pandemic.
